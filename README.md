# Healthy_City_Assessment

This is the readme file for the Healthy City Assessment project that is being hosted by MSU. This project aims to enhance the analysis of health data in the tri-county area, particularily for vulnerable elderly populations. This project is hosted by the Center of Community and Economic Development at MSU, and they have partnered with a group of students from MSU's cmse495 class. CMSE495 is the capstone class for the Computational Data Science program, and it revolves around a single collabrative group project between community partner and student group. This repository is run by the student group responsible for the Healthy City Assessment project, who are Frank Luginbill, Noah Mueller, Jun Han, and Amman Thasin.

Folder organization:
(update as we add code)


Ground rules for maintaining this repository:
1. If you add, remove, or edit any folders, make sure to document it above so that we can keep track of it.
2. For handling weekly work, make a branch to work locally, and then when we meet in class we can discuss the changes made and merge it together
