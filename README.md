This is the readme file for the Healthy_City_Assessment project that is being hosted by MSU.

Folder organization and explaination:


Ground rules for maintaining this repository:
1. If you add, remove, or edit any folders, make sure to document it above so that we can keep track of it.
2. For handling weekly work, make a branch to work locally, and then when we meet in class we can discuss the changes made and merge it together
